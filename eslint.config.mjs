/**
 * Repo-wide lint pass.
 *
 * `turbo run lint` resolves to exactly one real task (web#lint), so before this config the
 * two service-role-wielding workers, the e2e harness, the root scripts and all four
 * packages were never linted at all. This config covers everything turbo does not, and the
 * root `lint` script runs both.
 *
 * The rule set is deliberately small and syntax-only (no type-aware program, which would
 * need a tsconfig covering root scripts that no workspace owns). It is scoped to real
 * defects — unused bindings, unreachable or duplicated code, shadowed built-ins — not
 * style. A lint that has to be argued with on every PR gets disabled, and a disabled lint
 * catches nothing.
